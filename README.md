# ContinuousConsistentVoting

Thank you for your interest in replicating our analyses! We hope you encounter no difficulties in doing so, and have striven to make
this process as straightforward as possible. Do bear in mind that replicating our analyses may take you some time due to the necessity
of downloading a number of different datasets from different website, and the fact that these scripts can take a long time to run due 
to the large size of the data objects they use. 

*To replicate the analyses and reproduce the graphs in full:*

    1. You will need to download the data sources using the information provided in the paper (we lack permission to share them ourselves)
        Ensure to align the names of the source files you save with those in the scripts 
        Also bear in mind that depending on your software and settings, your table and spreadsheet headings may differ to ours
        Remove superfluous headers if you have any difficulties running the code dealing with third-party data sources
     
    2. You will need to download PPMatrix_trim.csv, available on the github page

    3. Run the scripts in numerical order

    4. Run our stata do files on the 'cut_for_stata' files produced in the sixth script, also available on the github page.
    
       Note that the alternative construction referred to in the paper as 'All-Estimate' is referred to as '_Unprejudiced' in the code

*To just replicate the final multi-level regression analysis:*

    You will need to download the following data files and run the stata do files available on the github page:

*To just replicate the continuous consistency calculation:*

    You will need to download the following data files and run the sixth script:
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1B4K72OZV6QT7Okud6_z9j-xRDESESQ/view?usp=sharing
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1EIpi1QHZ8BTntkkqzIcyM_ytJ3FZ9U/view?usp=sharing
        
We share these files here as they are too large to host on github.

Contact David Young (dy286@cam.ac.uk) if you have any difficulties running these scripts, or other related queries or suggestions.
